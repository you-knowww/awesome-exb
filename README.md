List of ESRI Experience Builder community widgets

| Widget | Link | Description | 
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Layer Focus Button | [ArcGIS Community](https://community.esri.com/t5/experience-builder-custom-widgets/layer-focus-button-custom-experience-builder/m-p/1592375/highlight/true#M479) | In the settings panel you can choose a map and a layer, and then the UI of the widget is a single button that when clicked will turn that selected layer on and all other layers off. It is not extensively tested, so use at your own risk and please post if you make any improvements to it. |
