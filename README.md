However, the user interface needs some improvement.<br><br>This widget has modified his code to improve the overall user experience.<br><br>Changes:<br>* Many of the internal menus were displaying behind other menus making them difficult or impossible to access. These issues should all be fixed.<br>* Text added to clarify if the widget is in draw or edit mode and how to access the other mode.<br>* The draw tools have been placed in a flexbox div to make the layout better organized.<br>* The options button has been widened and labeled to make it clear that is different than the draw tool buttons.<br>* The Undo/Redo buttons will only display if it is possible to undo or redo something.<br>* Text in the delete button will clarify if deleting a single or all graphics.<br>* Text options menu has been re-ordered and re-designed with additional text to clarify options.<br>* Entering text does not require deleting default text.<br>* Preview will accurately reflect the map symbol regardless of theme font. |
